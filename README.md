# CAST-AROUND
<br />

A node based application that would help those who are house-hunting to effectively
store their house search details and log ideas. A user creates an account on the app and logs in. There after they are taken to the search page to search for the home property they are interesting in seeing. They can then save this to the dashboard. From there they have the option the add more details about the house as and when they get the details, for eg: what they liked or did not like about the house, offer price they are thinking of etc.

## MOTIVATION
<br />

Having been a house hunter myself , I had been looking for a easy to remember my search about the different properties I saw, what I liked or did not like about the houses. I felt  that what was missing was a way to have those ideas and information collected at one point would have made life easier then. That is the motivation for this app.
